A variety of Computer Vision projects:


- Project 1: Edge Detection
  
  A custom implementation of the Canny Edge Detector, from scratch

  
- Project 2: Object Detection
  
  An object detection system which, given multiple object templates, localizes the object in the test image.
  Generates interest points for both the test and template images derived from a custom implementation of the Harris corner detector,
  constructs a SIFT-like feature descriptor for each interest point, then uses Hough transform to localize the object in the test image.


- Project 3: Image Classification and Segmentation
  
  Image classification and segmentation using convolutional neural networks.
